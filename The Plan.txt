I WANT THE NAVLINK TO MAKE A MODAL SHOW UP NO MATTER WHERE ON THE SITE YOU ARE
I DON'T WANT IT TO RERENDER THE PAGE, JUST MAKE THE MODAL VISIBLE
THE NAVLINK DOESN'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE STATE, SO IT SHOULD BE DONE IN APP.JS 
APP.JS WILL RENDER IT AND I DON'T KNOW. NAVLINK NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT SHOW
I CAN JUST GIVE IT AN ONCLICK THAT'LL MAKE IT SHOW. IT DOESN'T NEED STATE
APP.JS WILL DO EVERYTHING.
