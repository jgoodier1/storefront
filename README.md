# React Storefront

Welcome to my website's repository. This is the repository for the React front-end. You can view the repository for the Node/Express back-end [here](https://github.com/jgoodier1/storefront-api). You can view the site itself [here](https://storefront-app.netlify.app). You can view my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-goodier-b64a5586/).

This front-end was built utilizing React Hooks and TypeScript. I also used tools such as React Router DOM, axios, and Formik. I used styled-components for CSS, and React-Testing-Library to write test (I haven't finished writing tests for the entire app yet). After I finish writing the tests, I plan on converting the app to Redux, mostly for practice. I didn't use Redux from the beginning because it seemed like overkill for the size and complexity of this app.

Thank you for spending some time looking at my app.
