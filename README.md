# React Storefront

Welcome to my website's repository. This is the repository for the React front-end. You can view the repository for the Node/Express back-end [here](https://github.com/jgoodier1/storefront-api). You can view the site itself [here](https://storefront-app.netlify.app). You can view my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-goodier-b64a5586/).

This front-end was built utilizing React Hooks and TypeScript. I also used tools such as React Router DOM, Redux, axios, and Formik. I used styled-components for CSS, and React-Testing-Library to write test (I haven't finished writing tests for the entire app yet). 

Thank you for spending some time looking at my app.
